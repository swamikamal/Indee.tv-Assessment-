## Interview Assessment: Automation Script Development  

As part of a technical assessment for a Senior QA Engineer role, I was tasked with developing an **automation script** to execute a set of predefined test cases. The process involved:  

- **Analyzing Test Cases**: Understanding the requirements and scenarios provided.  
- **Script Development**: Writing a robust automation script to validate the test cases efficiently.  
- **Recording the Process**: Documenting and recording the entire process, from scripting to execution, to showcase my approach, methodology, and technical expertise.  

This assessment highlighted my ability to quickly adapt to requirements, build effective automation solutions, and deliver high-quality results under time constraints.
